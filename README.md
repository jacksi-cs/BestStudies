Deviations:  
  
-Got more done on login than we expected but still have more to do like creating Facebook and Google linking  
-Pushed Sound Detection down to stretch goals because even if added, would be an experimental/optional feature  
-For the sessions, our current session view is without swiping capabilities. We were having issues getting UIPageViewController working in container, and have pushed it to be resolved ASAP in Beta  
-Settings for Account, Linking, Sounds, and Notifications were not fully implemented as some of them required implementation of features that were slated for Beta or were not mentioned at all  
-Some ViewControllers are unused, in part due to experimentation and preplanning for future features or VCs
